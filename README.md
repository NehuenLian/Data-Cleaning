This 'project' is simply a data cleaning practice, in this project i explored the manual methods of data cleaning.
I've used functions like 'replace()', insert() to move columns, 'drop()', to fill the salary column with random values between 82.000 - 134.000, simulating annual salaries, because the original column has a huge amount of corrupted data.
Also, i've used efficient methods for verifying null values, like isnull() or any().
Additionally, I created some graphs to complement the analysis.
Verifying duplicates was not necessary in the context of the dataset.

Note: the data is not real nor precise. And was used only for practice purposes.
